I think the most important skill in life is being able to fake confidence.
I'm pretty convinced that everyone feels at least a little bit scared and alone.
But being able to trick others into thinking you have it all together...
That's a key part of getting people to respect and admire you.
I think I got pretty good at that over the years.
I don't show my weaknesses very often.
But because of that, I haven't had many people I could really open up to...
I mean, when do you reach the point in a friendship where you can start expressing your vulnerabilities?
Anyway...that's one reason I'm so glad I have you now.
I feel like I'm a little bit less scared and alone, when you're here with me.
Do you feel the same way?
I really want to be that person for you.
