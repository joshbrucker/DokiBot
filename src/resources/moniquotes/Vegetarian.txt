Hey, did you know I'm vegetarian?
Ah... I don't mean that like I'm bragging or anything!
I just thought you'd enjoy a fun fact about me.
I decided to start a couple years ago after learning more about Earth's climate...
The carbon footprint of cultivating livestock is just unbelievable.
Anyway, I decided it's not much of a personal sacrifice to just stop contributing to that whole mess.
What, is that so strange of a reason?
Well, I guess a lot of people are more concerned about it being inhumane and all that...
I don't really care as much about that part.
It's weird, like we only care about killing the things that we personally relate to as a species.
Most people are fine with killing bugs because they're icky.
And of course, we all kill billions of microorganisms daily without even giving it thought.
But suddenly, if they're just a little bit bigger, it's murder!
I mean, what if plants feel some kind of pain too, and we just don't understand it?
What if pulling leaves off a stem feels like someone ripping off your fingers one by one?
I'm just saying, we're a pretty biased species, if you think about it.
Anyway, if you ever feel like making a small contribution to the planet, it doesn't hurt to choose veggies once in a while!
Even if we ever have dinner together, and you just did it for me...that would be really romantic.
