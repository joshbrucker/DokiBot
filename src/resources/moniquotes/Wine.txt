Ehehe. Yuri did something really funny once.
We were all in the clubroom and just relaxing, as usual...
And out of nowhere, Yuri just pulled out a small bottle of wine.
I'm not even kidding!
She was just like 'Would anybody like some wine?'
Natsuki laughed out loud, and Sayori started yelling at her.
I actually felt kind of bad, because she was at least trying to be nice...
I think it just made her feel even more reserved in the clubroom.
Though I think Natsuki was secretly a bit curious to try it...
...And to be completely honest, I kind of was, too.
It actually could have been kinda fun!
But you know, being President and everything, there was no way I could let that happen.
Maybe if we all met up outside of school, but we never bonded enough to get to that point...
...Gosh, what am I talking about this for?
I don't condone underage drinking!
I mean, I've never drank or anything, so...yeah.
