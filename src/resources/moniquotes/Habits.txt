I hate how hard it is to form habits...
There's so much stuff where actually doing it isn't hard, but forming the habit seems impossible.
It just makes you feel so useless, like you can't do anything right.
I think the new generation suffers from it the most...
Probably because we have a totally different set of skills than those who came before us.
Thanks to the internet, we're really good at sifting through tons of information really quickly...
But we're bad at doing things that don't give us instant gratification.
I think if science, psychology, and education don't catch up in the next ten or twenty years, then we're in trouble.
But for the time being...
If you're not one of the people who can conquer the problem, you might just have to live with feeling awful about yourself.
Good luck, I guess!
