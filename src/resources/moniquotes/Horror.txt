Hey, do you like horror?
I remember we talked about it a little bit when you first joined the club.
I can enjoy horror novels, but not really horror movies.
The problem I have with horror movies is that most of them just rely on easy tactics.
Like dark lighting and scary-looking monsters and jump scares, and things like that.
It's not fun or inspiring to get scared by stuff that just takes advantage of human instinct.
But with novels, it's a little different.
The story and writing need to be descriptive enough to put genuinely disturbing thoughts into the reader's head.
It really needs to etch them deeply into the story and characters, and just mess with your mind.
In my opinion, there's nothing more creepy than things just being slightly off.
Like if you set up a bunch of expectations on what the story is going to be about...
...And then, you just start inverting things and pulling the pieces apart.
So even though the story doesn't feel like it's trying to be scary, the reader feels really deeply unsettled.
Like they know that something horribly wrong is hiding beneath the cracks, just waiting to surface.
God, just thinking about it gives me the chills.
That's the kind of horror I can really appreciate.
But I guess you're the kind of person who plays cute romance games, right?
Ahaha, don't worry.
I won't make you read any horror stories anytime soon.
I can't really complain if we just stick with the romance~
