You know, it kinda sucks to be the creative type...
It feels like they work so hard but get almost nothing for it.
You know, like artists, writers, actors...
It's sad because there's so much beautiful talent in the world, but most of it goes unseen...and unpaid.
I guess that just means there's a huge surplus of creativity, huh?
Kind of makes you feel like you're just not special at all...
But that's fine! You're supposed to just write for yourself anyway, right?
Yeah...
