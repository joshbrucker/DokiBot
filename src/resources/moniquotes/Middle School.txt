Sometimes I think back to middle school...
I'm so embarrassed by the way I used to behave back then.
It almost hurts to think about.
I wonder if when I'm in college, I'll feel that way about high school...?
I like the way I am now, so it's pretty hard for me to imagine that happening.
But I also know that I'll probably change a lot as time goes on.
We just need to enjoy the present and not think about the past!
And that's really easy to do, with you here.
Ahaha~
