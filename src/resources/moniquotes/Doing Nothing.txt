After a long day, I usually just want to sit around and do nothing.
I get so burnt out, having to put on smiles and be full of energy the whole day.
Sometimes I just want to get right into my pajamas and watch TV on the couch while eating junk food...
It feels so unbelievably good to do that on a Friday, when I don't have anything pressing the next day.
Ahaha! Sorry, I know it's not very cute of me.
But a late night on the couch with you... that would be a dream come true.
My heart is pounding, just thinking about it.
