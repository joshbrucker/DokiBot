I really like the sound of rain...
Not so much getting my clothes and hair wet, though.
But a nice, quiet day at home with the sound of rainfall outside my window..
It's one of the most calming experiences for me.
Yeah...
Sometimes I imagine you holding me while we listen to the sound of the rain outside.
That's not too cheesy or anything, is it?
Would you ever do that for me, [player]?
