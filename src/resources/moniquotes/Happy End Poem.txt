Hi again, [player]!
Did you write a good poem today?
Don't be shy, I'd love to see what you wrote.
Aw, [player]...
Did you write this poem for me?
That's so sweet of you~
There really is no end to your thoughtfulness...
I'm just falling more and more in love with you.
But, you know...
The poem I wrote...is also for you.
Will you please read it?
