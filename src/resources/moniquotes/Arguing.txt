Back in my debate club days, I learned a whole lot about arguing.
The problem with arguing is that each person sees their opinion as the superior one.
That's kind of stating the obvious, but it affects the way they try to get their point across.
Let's say you really like a certain movie, right?
If someone comes along and tells you the movie sucks, because it did X and Y wrong...
Doesn't that make you feel kind of personally attacked?
It's because by saying that, it's like they're implying that you have bad taste.
And once emotions enter the picture, it's almost guaranteed that both people will be left sour.
But it's all about language!
If you make everything as subjective-sounding as possible, then people will listen to you without feeling attacked.
You could say 'I'm personally not a fan of it' and 'I felt I'd like it more if it did X and Y'...things like that.
It even works when you're citing facts about things.
If you say 'I read on this website that it works like this'...
Or if you admit that you're not an expert on it...
Then it's much more like you're putting your knowledge on the table, rather than forcing it onto them.
If you put in an active effort to keep the discussion mutual and level, they usually follow suit.
Then, you can share your opinions without anyone getting upset from just a disagreement.
Plus, people will start seeing you as open-minded and a good listener!
It's a win-win, you know?
... Well, I guess that would be Monika's Debate Tip of the Day!
Ahaha! That sounds a little silly. Thanks for listening, though.
