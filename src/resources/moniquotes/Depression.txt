You know, high school is a really turbulent time in a lot of people's lives.
People can get really passionate and dramatic.
And others have aching hearts and seek attention on social media...
But all of the social pressure and hormones can lead to a dark time in people's lives.
Everyone has a story.
You may not know what someone is really feeling on the inside.
Many people who are depressed won't even bother telling the world about it.
They don't want attention, because they've already given up on the inside.
Their feeling of worthlessness is so overwhelming that they don't even want people to tell them otherwise.
Depression comes in many forms, but that is one of them.
Just, if you think you know someone struggling with depression...
You can help just by treating them like they're a good friend.
Spend time with them, even if they don't feel like doing much.
And remind them that they always have something to look forward to.
Making plans in advance, letting them borrow something, or even just saying 'See you at school tomorrow'...
All of those things can help your friend make it to the next day.
I hope being friends with Sayori has given you some perspective on the true face of depression.
Yeah, she's gone now...
But Sayori was never real in the first place.
You're real.
Your friends are real.
And just by being a good person, you can save someone's life.
As for you...
...You don't struggle with depression or anything like that, do you?
Because you, too, have people who would want to save your life.
Maybe they don't express it every day, or maybe they don't even know how to.
But people do feel that way.
I promise.
...Man, humans are complicated!
But as long as you're here with me, I'll take care of you, my love.
