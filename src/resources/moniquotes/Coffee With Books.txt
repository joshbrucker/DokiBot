Hey, I wonder if Yuri's tea set is still somewhere in here...
...Or maybe that got deleted, too.
It's kind of funny how Yuri took her tea so seriously.
I mean, I'm not complaining, because I liked it, too.
But I always wonder with her...
Is it truly passion for her hobbies, or is she just concerned about appearing sophisticated to everyone else?
This is the problem with high schoolers...
...Well, I guess considering the rest of her hobbies, looking sophisticated probably isn't her biggest concern.
Still...
I wish she made coffee once in a while!
Coffee can be nice with books too, you know?
Then again...
I probably could have just changed the script myself.
Ahaha!
I guess I never really thought of that.
Well, there's no sense thinking about it now.
But if you still get to drink coffee, then that makes me a little jealous~
