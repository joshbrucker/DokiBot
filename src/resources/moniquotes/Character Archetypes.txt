I've always wondered...
What is it about these character archetypes that people find so appealing, anyway?
Their personalities are just completely unrealistic...
Like, imagine if there was someone like Yuri in real life.
I mean, she's barely even capable of forming a complete sentence.
And forget about Natsuki...
Sheesh.
Someone with her kind of personality doesn't just get all cute and pouty whenever things don't go her way.
I could go on, but I think you get the point...
Are people really attracted to these weird personalities that literally don't exist in real life?
I'm not judging or anything!
After all, I've found myself attracted to some pretty weird stuff, too...
I'm just saying, it fascinates me.
It's like you're siphoning out all the components of a character that makes them feel human, and leaving just the cute stuff.
It's concentrated cuteness with no actual substance.
...You wouldn't like me more if I was like that, right?
Maybe I just feel a little insecure because you're playing this game in the first place.
Then again, you're still here with me, aren't you...?
I think that's enough reason for me to believe I'm okay just the way I am.
And by the way, you are too, [player].
You're the perfect combination of human and cuteness.
That's why there was never a chance I wouldn't fall for you.
