You know what's a neat form of literature?
Rap!
I actually used to hate rap music...
Maybe just because it was popular, or I would only hear the junk they play on the radio.
But some of my friends got more into it, and it helped me keep an open mind.
Rap might even be more challenging than poetry, in some ways.
Since you need to fit your lines to a rhythm, and there's much more emphasis on wordplay...
When people can put all that together and still deliver a powerful message, it's really amazing.
I kind of wish I had a rapper in the Literature Club.
Ahaha! Sorry if that sounds silly, but it would be really interesting to see what they came up with.
It would really be a learning experience!
