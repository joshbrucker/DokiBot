[player], do you get good sleep?
It can be really hard to get enough sleep nowadays.
Especially in high school, when you're forced to wake up so early every day...
I'm sure college is a little bit better, since you probably have a more flexible schedule.
Then again, I hear a lot of people in college stay up all night anyway, for no real reason.
Is that true?
Anyway, I saw some studies that talked about the horrible short-term and long-term effects caused by lack of sleep.
It seems like mental functions, health, and even lifespan can be dramatically impacted by it.
I just think you're really great and wanted to make sure you're not accidentally destroying yourself.
So try to keep your sleep on track, okay?
I'll always wait for you in the morning, so make sure you put your own well-being before anything else.
