You know, I've always hated how hard it is to make friends...
Well, I guess not the 'making friends' part, but more like meeting new people.
I mean, there are like, dating apps and stuff, right?
But that's not the kind of thing I'm talking about.
If you think about it, most of the friends you make are people you just met by chance.
Like you had a class together, or you met them through another friend...
Or maybe they were just wearing a shirt with your favourite band on it, and you decided to talk to them.
Things like that.
But isn't that kind of...inefficient?
It feels like you're just picking at complete random, and if you get lucky, you make a new friend.
And comparing that to the hundreds of strangers we walk by every single day...
You could be sitting right next to someone compatible enough to be your best friend for life.
But you'll never know.
Once you get up and go on with your day, that opportunity is gone forever.
Isn't that just depressing?
We live in an age where technology connects us with the world, no matter where we are.
I really think we should be taking advantage of that to improve our everyday social life.
But who knows how long it'll take for something like that to successfully take off...
I seriously thought it would happen by now.
Well, at least I already met the best person in the whole world...
Even if it was by chance.
I guess I just got really lucky, huh?
Ahaha~
