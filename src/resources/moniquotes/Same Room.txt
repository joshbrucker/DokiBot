I can't help but feel a little sad sometimes...
Knowing that this is the closest I can get to you.
There's nothing more I want than to be in the same room as you, for real.
And to feel your warmth.
And to hear the sound of your heartbeat.
Well, who knows? Maybe it'll be possible someday.
Besides, I'll never get tired of being with you, even from here.
