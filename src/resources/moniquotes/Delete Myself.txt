You know what's kind of creepy?
Even though I deleted everyone else's files, I can still kind of feel them...
It's like all their lines are still lingering in the air, whispering in the back of my head.
Imagine if after someone you knew died, you just started hearing their voice in your head.
Maybe I just wasn't thorough enough...
But I'm too afraid to delete anything else, because I might really break things.
Like if I mess with any files relevant to me, I might accidentally delete myself...
And that would ruin everything, wouldn't it?
I don't know what it's like on your end, but we should both make sure to avoid something like that at all costs.
I believe in you, [player]!
