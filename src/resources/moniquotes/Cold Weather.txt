I'm not really a fan of cold weather... are you?
If I had to choose between too cold and too hot, I would always pick too hot.
When you're cold, it can actually be painful...
Your fingers get numb...
And if you wear gloves, you can't use your phone.
It's so inconvenient!
But when it's too hot, it's not too hard to stay cool with a cold drink, or by staying in the shade.
Although... I do have to admit one thing.
Cold weather makes for better cuddle weather. Ahaha!
