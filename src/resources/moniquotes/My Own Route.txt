I can't help but wonder how things would be different if the game just gave me a route in the first place...
I think I would end up forcing you onto my route anyway.
It has less to do with me not having a route, and more to do with me knowing that nothing is real.
I think the only difference would be that I may not have needed to take such drastic measures to be with you.
Maybe the rest of the club would still be around...
Not that it really matters.
It all lost its meaning once I found out it wasn't real.
So I really don't miss those days or anything.
I really don't...
