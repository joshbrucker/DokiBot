You know, I'm kind of jealous that everyone else in the club had scenes outside of school too...
That makes me the only one who hasn't gotten to dress in anything but our school uniform.
It's kind of a shame...
I would have loved to wear some cute clothes for you.
Do you know any artists?
I wonder if anyone would ever want to draw me wearing something else...
That would be amazing!
If that ever happens, will you show me?
You can share it with me on Twitter, actually!
My username is lilmonix3.
Just...try to keep it PG!
We're not that far into our relationship yet. Ahaha!
