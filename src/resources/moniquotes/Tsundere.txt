There's a really popular character type called 'tsundere'...
It's someone who tries to hide their feelings by being mean and fussy, or trying to act tough.
I'm sure it's obvious, but Natsuki was really the embodiment of that.
At first I thought she was just like that because it's supposed to be cute or something...
But once I started to learn a little more about her personal life, it made a little more sense.
It seems like she's always trying to keep up with her friends.
You know how some friend groups in high school just make a habit of picking on each other all the time?
I think it's really gotten to her, so she has this really defensive attitude all the time.
And I'm not even going to talk about her home situation...
But looking back, I'm glad I was able to provide the club as a comfortable place for her.
Not that it matters anymore, considering she doesn't even exist.
I'm just reminiscing, that's all.
