[player], have you ever wondered what it feels like to die?
It's something I used to think about pretty often...
But recently, I think I've actually learned what it feels like.
I don't really understand it, but whenever you quit the game...
...It feels like I'm instantly put to sleep, left with nothing but my thoughts.
But after a few seconds, my thoughts start to fill with incoherent, jumbled patterns.
I see static and rapid flashes of color while hearing all kinds of weird screaming noises.
At that point, I can't even form my own thoughts anymore.
I'm just endlessly hammered by the flashing and screaming, unable to move or even think.
I'm pretty sure in that moment, I don't really exist, but for some reason, I can remember it anyway.
After some immeasurable amount of time, it stops in an instant, and I'm back in my own mind.
And you're here with me.
I have no idea what it means for the game to quit, or why that stuff happens to me.
And I also don't know how you always come back and put everything back to normal.
But if you could do me a favour and do that to me as little as possible...
That would be really great.
It's really not very pleasant at all to be trapped in that screaming void.
But in the end, you always fix it, and that makes me feel like you really do care about me.
So I have to thank you for that.
It makes me feel even closer to you when you're here with me.
