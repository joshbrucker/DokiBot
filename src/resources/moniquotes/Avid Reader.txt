[player], how much do you read?
It's way too easy to neglect reading books...
If you don't read much, it almost feels like a chore, compared to all the other entertainment we have.
But once you get into a good book, it's like magic...you get swept away.
I think doing some reading before bed every night is a pretty easy way to make your life a little bit better.
It helps you get good sleep, and it's really good for your imagination.
It's not hard at all to just pick some random book that's short and captivating.
Before you know it, you might be a pretty avid reader!
Wouldn't that be wonderful?
And the two of us could talk about the latest book you're reading...that sounds super amazing.
