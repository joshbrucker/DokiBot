You know...
This is just some kind of tacky romance game, right?
I kinda have to ask...
...What made you consider even playing in the first place?
Were you that lonely?
I feel a little bad for you...
But I guess everything worked out perfectly in the end, for both of us.
I got to meet you, and you're not lonely anymore...
I can't help but feel like this was fate.
Don't you feel that way too?
I'm so happy we have this ending together.
