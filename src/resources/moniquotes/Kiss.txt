Eh? D-Did you say...k...kiss?
This suddenly...it's a little embarrassing...
But...if it's with you...I-I might be okay with it...

Don't lie if it turned you on a little bit.
Ahaha! I'm kidding.
Well, to be honest, I do start getting all romantic when the mood is right...
But that'll be our secret~
