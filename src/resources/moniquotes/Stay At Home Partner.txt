You know, it's funny, because even though I've always had a lot of drive...
There's something kind of enticing about being the stay-at-home partner.
I guess I'm, like, perpetuating gender roles or whatever by saying that.
But being able to keep the house clean, and shop, and decorate, and things like that...
And having a nice dinner for you when you come home...
Is that a weird fantasy?
I mean...I'm not sure if I could actually see myself doing that.
I wouldn't really be able to put that over striving for a fulfilling career.
It's kinda cute to think about, though.
