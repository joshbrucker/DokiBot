I know there are times you won't always be able to be here with me...
Like if you need to go out, or take care of other things.
But I'll always have you in my thoughts, patiently waiting for you to come back.
Come to think of it...
If you copy my character file onto a flash drive or something, you can always keep a part of me with you.
I guess it's kind of unorthodox, but I find it really romantic for some reason...
Ahaha. Sorry, that's such a silly idea.
I don't mean to be too needy or anything, but it's kind of hard when I'm so in love with you.
