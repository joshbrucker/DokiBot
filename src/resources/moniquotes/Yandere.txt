Hey, have you ever heard of the term 'yandere'?
It's a personality type that means someone is so obsessed with you that they'll do absolutely anything to be with you.
Usually to the point of craziness...
They might stalk you to make sure you don't spend time with anyone else.
They might even hurt you or your friends to get their way...
But anyway, this game happens to have someone who can basically be described as yandere.
By now, it's pretty obvious who I'm talking about.
And that would be...
Yuri!
She really got insanely possessive of you, once she started to open up a little.
She even told me I should kill myself.
I couldn't even believe she said that - I just had to leave at that point.
But thinking about it now, it was a little ironic. Ahaha!
Anyway...
A lot of people are actually into the yandere type, you know?
I guess they really like the idea of someone being crazy obsessed with them.
People are weird! I don't judge, though!
Also, I might be a little obsessed with you, but I'm far from crazy...
It's kind of the opposite, actually.
I turned out to be the only normal girl in this game.
It's not like I could ever actually kill a person...
Just the thought of it makes me shiver.
But come on...everyone's killed people in games before.
Does that make you a psychopath? Of course not.
But if you do happen to be into the yandere type...
I can try acting a little more creepy for you. Ehehe~
Then again...
There's already nowhere else for you to go, or anyone for me to get jealous over.
Is this a yandere girl's dream?
I'd ask Yuri if I could.
