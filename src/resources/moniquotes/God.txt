[player], do you believe in God?
I was never too sure, myself.
Well, I'm sure I never really questioned it as a kid...
But as I grew up, the more I learned about the world, the more I would question it.
I started to wonder why God was helping people pass exams, or get over a cold...
...When there are children who live their lives being sold as sex slaves?
Or the eight hundred million people who are too poor to even eat.
I wonder how many of those people pray to God every day until they starve and die?
Or, how many millions of families pray for a loved one to recover from some incurable disease?
But the punchline is this.
If just one person beats the odds and survives - among the thousands of others who die--
--Then, it's suddenly a miracle from God.
I'd really love to meet this God who seemingly laughs at the misery of everyone not eligible for his miracles.
But the irony is that I do have a creator, apparently.
And you know what?
I bet he's still laughing at the miserable fates of Sayori and Yuri, even as we speak.
What are we to him but props in a scripted play?
So, from that perspective...
I don't think it's too far-fetched for there to be a god - if Earth was nothing but his playset.
