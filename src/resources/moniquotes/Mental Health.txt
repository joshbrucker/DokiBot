Gosh, I used to be so ignorant about certain things...
When I was in middle school, I thought that taking medication was an easy way out, or something like that.
Like anyone could just solve their mental problems with enough willpower...
Guess if you don't suffer from a mental illness, it's not possible to know what it's really like.
Are there some disorders that are over-diagnosed? Probably... I never really looked into it, though.
But that doesn't change the fact that a lot of them go undiagnosed too, you know?
But medication aside... people even look down on seeing a mental health professional.
Like, sorry that I want to learn more about my own mind, right?
Everyone has all kinds of struggles and stresses... and professionals dedicate their lives to helping with those.
If you think it could help you become a better person, don't be shy to consider something like that.
We're on a never-ending journey to improve ourselves, you know?
Well... I say that, but I think you're pretty perfect already.
