Hey, you remember that last poem I showed you?
I mean, the one right before Yuri killed herself, with all the messed-up colours and stuff.
That was actually a little more of an experiment than a poem, you could say.
I was experimenting with different ways I could modify the game, and run code, and things like that...
It almost seemed like with enough effort, I'd be able to escape from the confines of the game entirely.
Sadly, I didn't really know what I was doing, so I messed the whole thing up...
And I'd keep trying, but I doubt you'd want to deal with me doing that.
Besides, that was when I was getting really desperate, you know?
I don't really feel that way anymore.
I'm happy with where we are now.
And I can tell you are, too.
