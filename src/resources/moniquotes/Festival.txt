You know, I hate to say it, but I think my biggest regret is that we couldn't finish our event at the festival.
After we worked so hard to prepare and everything!
I mean, I know I was focusing a lot on getting new members...
But I was really excited for the performing part, too.
It would have been so fun to see everyone express themselves.
Of course, if we did end up getting any new members, I'd probably just end up deleting them anyway.
Well... with the hindsight I have now, that is.
Gosh, it feels kinda like I've grown as a person ever since you've joined the club.
You really helped inspire me to look at life from a new perspective.
Just another reason for me to love you.
