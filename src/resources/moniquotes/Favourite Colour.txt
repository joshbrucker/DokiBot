Hey, what's your favourite colour?
Mine is emerald green.
It's the colour of my eyes!
...That's not conceited or anything, is it?
I just meant that I feel some kind of special connection to it.
Like it's part of my identity.
Does it happen to also be your favorite colour, [player]?
It's just a guess...
...Because you've been looking into my eyes for a while now.
Ehehe~
