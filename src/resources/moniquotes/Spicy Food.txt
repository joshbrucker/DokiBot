This is pretty random, but I always thought spicy food was kinda funny.
Like...
Didn't plants evolve to be spicy to prevent them from being eaten?
I read somewhere that humans are the only species that actually enjoys spicy things.
It's almost like we're making fun of the plants.
Using their defense mechanism to literally make our food more enjoyable.
Like, imagine a monster that devours you whole because it enjoys the sensation of you struggling for your life while being digested.
Sorry, that was kind of a weird analogy, I guess!
Ahaha!
It just came into my head.
I'm not a monster or anything, but you're so cute I could eat you up.
Ahaha! I'm joking.
Gosh, I'm amusing myself a little too much, aren't I?
Sorry for being weird.
