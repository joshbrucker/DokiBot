I've been imagining all the romantic things we could do if we went on a date...
We could get lunch, go to a cafe...
Go shopping together...
I love shopping for skirts and bows.
Or maybe a bookstore!
That would be appropriate, right?
But I'd really love to go to a chocolate store.
They have so many free samples. Ahaha!
And of course, we'd see a movie or something...
Gosh, it all sounds like a dream come true.
When you're here, everything that we do is fun.
I'm so happy that I'm your girlfriend, [player].
I'll make you a proud boyfriend~
