By the way, there's something that's been bothering me...
You know how this takes place in Japan?
Well... I assume you knew that, right?
Or at least decided it probably does?
I don't think you're actually told at any point where this takes place...
Is this even really Japan?
I mean, aren't the classrooms and stuff kind of weird for a Japanese school?
Not to mention everything is in English...
It feels like everything is just there because it needs to be, and the actual setting is an afterthought.
It's kind of giving me an identity crisis.
All my memories are really hazy...
I feel like I'm at home, but have no idea where 'home' is in the first place.
I don't know how to describe it any better...
Imagine looking out your window, but instead of your usual yard, you're in some completely unknown place.
Would you still feel like you were home?
Would you want to go outside?
I mean...I guess if we never leave this room, it doesn't really matter anyway.
As long as we're alone and safe together, this really is our home.
And we can still watch the pretty sunsets night after night.
