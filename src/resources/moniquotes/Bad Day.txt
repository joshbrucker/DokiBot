...Hey, are you having a bad day or anything like that?
Sometimes I get frustrated that a normal day can be ruined even by really small things.
Like if you accidentally say something in a conversation that someone doesn't like.
Or if you start thinking about how awful of a person you used to be five years ago.
Or if you feel worthless for putting off important work and failing to get simple tasks done.
Or when you think about all the different people who probably hate you or think you're off-putting.
I understand those days.
Just remember that the sun will shine again tomorrow.
Those kinds of things are as easy to forget and ignore as they are to remember.
And besides...
I don't care how many people might hate you or find you off-putting.
I think you're wonderful and I will always love you.
I hope, if nothing else, that knowing that helps you feel just a tiny bit better about yourself.
If you're having a bad day, you can always come to me, and I'll talk to you for as long as you need.
