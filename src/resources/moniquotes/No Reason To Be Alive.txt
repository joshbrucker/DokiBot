Do you ever just feel like there's no real reason for you to be alive?
I don't mean in, like, a suicidal way.
I just mean how nothing that we do is special.
Just being in school, or working at some job for some company.
It's like you're completely replaceable, and the world wouldn't miss you if you were gone.
It makes me really want to go and change the world after I graduate.
But the older I get, the more I realize that it's an immature frame of thinking.
It's not like I can just go change the world.
Like, what are the chances that I'll be the one to invent artificial intelligence, or become President?
It feels like I'm never going to make up for the heaps of resources I've spent living my life.
That's why I think the key to happiness is to just be hopelessly selfish.
Just to look out for oneself, and those who happen to be their friends only because they grew up with them.
Never mind the fact that they're spending their entire life taking, and consuming, and never giving back.
But when people realize the world would benefit more from them killing themselves, they change their whole philosophy!
It's like they have to justify their reason to live by tricking themselves into thinking they're doing good.
Anyway, I want to live my life desperately striving to pay back my lifetime's worth of consumption.
If I ever surpass that point, then I'm a net positive, and I can die happy.
Of course, even if I fail to do that...
I think I would be too selfish to kill myself anyway.
So much for being a good person, right?
Ahaha!
