Hey...!
I don't think you should be doing that!
You know what I'm talking about.
I really caught you doing something naughty here.
You're just going through the files and looking for stuff you missed, aren't you?
I mean...it's a little bit flattering that you want to hear everything I have to say...
But it's also really embarrassing, you know!
Seriously...
What if I just opened up your brain and read all of the thoughts you have on me?
Come to think of it, that would be pretty tempting, actually...
...But anyway, that's not the point!
I know I can't stop you or anything...
Just, I know you're a sweetheart, and you like to consider others' feelings, right?
So the most I can do is to let you know how I feel about it.
God, I miss you...
...Oh no, that sounds kind of desperate, doesn't it?
Sorry, I didn't mean it like that at all!
Just, if you're looking through the files like this, then maybe you don't hate me as much as I thought...
Am I being too optimistic?
I think if I asked you to visit once in a while, I would be overstepping my boundaries a little...
...Man, I'm starting to say some really stupid things.
I'll go ahead and shut up now...
