# DokiBot

What started out as a fun gag with friends to keep track of so-called 'poems' has developed into a full-fledged Discord bot! If you enjoyed the game Doki Doki Literature Club, this bot is for you. It has been mostly used as a learning experience for me, but feel free to add the bot to your server if any of these features interest you.

# Features
### Doki-Poems
Make a channel called doki-poems and DokiBot will grab the first word said every minute/hour/day.
 
### Insults
Randomly throughout the day, DokiBot will mention someone and have a special message for them. (This is automatically **OFF** due to some insults containing adult-oriented language. Enable it on your server with -toggle)

### Other Features
There are a bunch of other small Easter eggs that are being implemented as DokiBot's development continues.
