# DokiBot

What started out as a fun gag with friends to keep track of so-called 'poems' has developed into a fully featured Discord bot! If you enjoyed the game Doki Doki Literature Club, this bot is for you. It has been mostly used as a learning experience for me, but feel free to add the bot to your server if any of these features interest you.

# Feature Overview
### Poems
DokiBot will randomly choose words throughout the day and create a "poem" with them! Once the poem is deemed completed, it will be sent in a text channel!
 
### Insults
Randomly once per day, DokiBot will have a special message for one person (or more) in your server. And creating insults is a community effort! All insults have been submitted by users (/insult submit) to be approved by the DokiBot development team.

### Anilist Integration
DokiBot, being the manga connoisseur that she is, has access to pulling data from Anilist. You can search for anime, manga, characters, and even user profiles!

### Images
Waifus, husbandos, dokis, oh my! DokiBot supports searching for all of these and more, allowing you to add additional tags for more specific image searches. 

### Other Features
There are a bunch of other small Easter eggs that are being implemented as DokiBot's development continues.

# Commands

## Poems
### /end
Ends the current poem and immediately outputs it to text chat.

### /frequency
Changes the frequency in which DokiBot grabs words for the poem.

---

## Insults
### /insult force
Forces DokiBot to send an insult. These insults will not have any upvote/downvote voting, and they will never @ a user, even if they have this feature enabled.

### /insult list
Lists your or another user's submitted insults and their statuses.

### /insult notifyme
Enable this to give DokiBot to @ you when it sends an insult and chooses your name. By default, this is off.

### /insult submit
Allows you to submit an insult for DokiBot to approve. Include the word "@user" where you would like DokiBot to insert a random user's name. Currently you can submit an insult every 24hr and can reset the cooldown instantly by voting on this website! 

### /insult toggle
Server members with the "Manager Server" permission can use this to turn on/off DokiBots random insults.

## Miscellaneous
### /help

### /ignoreme
Privacy feature - Toggles whether DokiBot can see your non-slash-command messages. This will stop DokiBot from triggering random events (insults, poems, etc.) and collecting poem words when you send a message. Slash commands **will** still work with this feature turned on.
